Modular Angular / Java application

Goal : 
Improve my knowledge on Angular and Java.

This application allows you to build a site as dynamically as possible.

Below, what I was able to improve :
- Angular
  - Dynamically build components by positioning them where you want them
  - Generate routes dynamically
- Java
  - Dynamically generate SQL queries using my classes AbstractQueryBuilderResource, AbstractQueryBuilderService, AbstractQueryBuilderRepository
